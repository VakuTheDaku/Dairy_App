## How to configure
We have already hosted it in here : 
but if u want to run it
1. clone the project, go to main directory and in terminal give - "npm i". (make sure to have npm installed)


## How to Run
1. After npm i (installing necessary dependencies) Now create .env file. The content cannot be shared here for obvious reasons (as it contains database information). You can mail me for details at vinayarunkumarkp3@gmail.com
2. Now go in terminal and run "npm run" or "npm start"(make sure npm is installed).
3. Go to localhost:8000 see the site up and running.
